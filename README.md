# 3D_flexible_ring_model_of_tire
This repository includes the codes in my master's thesis, “Theoretical model for contact features and tire wear considering six-component force at axle head”.

The codes simulate the contact pressure distribution of tire with 3D flexible ring tire model.
If you are interested in my work, you can read my thesis first. 
In addition, I have to apologize for my unstandard codes writen several years ago. I will rewrite these codes later.
